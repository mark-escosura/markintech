## Acknowledgments

Thank you to all the people that helped and gave great tips and feedback.

- Omi - [@Omi](/)
- Mariojuanna - [@mario](/)
- Caleb - [@CalebCo](https://github.com/CalebCo) - Gave feedback about my unfinished project. Gave me tips and feedback about how i can make my portfolio more interactive in a way by instead of saying Contact on the top right, have a message bubble appear somewhere as a user scroll, saying "Oh hey there, click this". I found this a really great addition to my portfolio.
